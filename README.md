## 📐 Project Overview

This project simulates a **PCB-based microstrip antenna**, typically used in wireless communication applications. The design is modeled on a standard dielectric substrate with a ground plane and microstrip feed line.

### Key Design Parameters:
- **Antenna Type**: Microstrip Patch Antenna
- **Substrate**: FR4
- **Target Frequency**: 2.4 GHz 
- **Simulation Tool**: CST Studio Suite

## 📊 Results Summary

The `results/` folder includes:
- S-parameter plots (S11 reflection coefficient)
- Gain and radiation pattern visualizations
- 3D field plots
- Exported performance data (CSV or images)

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. Download the `.cst` file from the provided Google Drive link.
2. Open it in **CST Studio Suite**.
3. Run simulations or modify design parameters as needed.

## 🧾 Notes

- Large binary files are excluded from this repo due to GitHub's file size limits.
- All relevant visual outputs and exports are included in `results/`.
